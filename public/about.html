<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, Zidhan's here, glad you come to my page. I'm an aspiring developer and self-taught from scratch. I really
  want to be a great developer in IT industry. I have no related IT background even though I was under faculty of
  Information Technology. I was taught about HTML, SQL, Web Design but only on the basic level when I was in college. 
  So, I decided to level up my knowledge in this field and pursue a tech career.
</p>

<p>This is my first project for web development. Yes, it looks like a joke hahaha and I know you guys can do more than me.
  However, I'm really proud that I can push myself to start this path. I really need your suppport to become a good developer
  in the future. Please, looking forward what I would create next time. See ya!
